APIs provide access to business-critical data. Unrestricted access can result in data breaches, monetary losses, or potential denial of service. Even for internal APIs, checks can be essential to limit data to authorized parties.

Enforcing authorization before processing requests is more efficient because it allows for early request termination. It also enhances security by creating an initial checkpoint that can be reinforced in other service layers.

The Apollo Router provides fine-grained access control at your graph's edge. Using the `@authenticated` and `@requiresScopes` directives, you can define access to specific fields and types across your supergraph:

- The `@authenticated` directive works in a binary way: authenticated requests can access the specified field or type and unauthenticated requests can't.
- The `@requiresScopes` directive allows granular access control through scopes you define.

You define and use these directives on subgraph schemas, and GraphOS [composes](#composition-and-federation) them on to the supergraph schema.
The router then enforces these directives on all incoming requests.

## Prerequisites

To use the router's authorization directives, you need to either configure [JWT authentication](./authn-jwt) or add a [router service coprocessor](../customizations/coprocessor) that adds **claims** to a request's context.
Claims are the individual details of a request's authentication and scope. They might include details like the ID of the associated user and/or any scopes assigned to that user.

### JWT authentication configuration

If you configure [JWT authentication](./authn-jwt), the Apollo Router automatically adds a JWT token's claims to the request's context at the `apollo_authentication::JWT::claims` key.

### Coprocessors for authorization

To participate in the authorization process, the coprocessor you add needs to set the key `apollo_authentication::JWT::claims` in request contexts.

To-do: Coprocessors specifications

## Authorization directives

### `@authenticated`

The `@authenticated` directive marks specific fields and types as requiring authentication.
It works by checking for the `apollo_authentication::JWT::claims` key in a request's context.
If the request is authenticated, the router executes the query in its entirety.

For unauthenticated requests, the router removes `@authenticated` fields before planning the query and only executes the parts of the query that don't require authentication.
If every field in a particular subgraph's query is marked as requiring authentication, this can eliminate entire subgraph requests.

#### Prerequisites

To use the `@authenticated` directive in a subgraph you can [import it from the `@link` directive](/federation/federated-types/federated-directives/#importing-directives) like so:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(
    url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.5",
    import: [..., "@authenticated"])
```

#### Example `@authenticated` use case

Suppose you are building a social media platform. Unauthenticated users can view all other parts of a public postâ€”its title, author, etc.
However, you only want authenticated users to be able to see a post's number of views.
You also want to be able to query for an authenticated user's information.

Your schema may look something like this:

```graphql
type Query {
  me: User @authenticated
  post(id: ID!): Post
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  author: User!
  title: String!
  content: String!
  views: Int @authenticated
}

```

Consider the following query:

```graphql title="Sample query"
query {
  me {
    name
  }
  post(id: "1234") {
    title
    views
  }
}
```

An authenticated request would execute the entire query.
For an unauthenticated request, the router would remove the `@authenticated` fields and execute the filtered query.

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Query executed for an authenticated request"
query {
  me {
    name
  }
  post(id: "1234") {
    title
    views
  }
}
```

```graphql title="Query executed for an unauthenticated request"
query {
  post(id: "1234") {
    title
  }
}
```

</CodeColumns>

For an unauthenticated request, the router doesn't attempt to resolve the top-level `me` query, nor the views for the post with `id: "1234"`.
The response retains the initial request's shape but returns `null` for unauthorized fields and applies the [standard GraphQL null propagation rules](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/graphql/basics/using-nullability-in-graphql/#what-happens-if-you-try-to-return-null-for-a-non-null-field).

```json title="Unauthenticated request's response"
{
  "data": {
    "me": null,
		"post": {
			"title": "Securing supergraphs",
		}
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Unauthorized field or type",
      "path": [
        "me"
      ],
      "extensions": {
        "code": "UNAUTHORIZED_FIELD_OR_TYPE"
      }
    },
    {
      "message": "Unauthorized field or type",
      "path": [
        "post",
        "views"
      ],
      "extensions": {
        "code": "UNAUTHORIZED_FIELD_OR_TYPE"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

If _every_ requested field requires authentication and a request is unauthenticated, the router generates an error indicating that the query is unauthorized.

### `@requiresScopes`

The `@requiresScopes` directive marks fields and types as restricted based on required scopes.
The directive should include a `scopes` argument that defines an array of the required scopes.

```graphql
@requiresScopes(scopes: ["scope1", "scope2", "scope3"])
```

The directive validates the required scopes by loading the claims object at the `apollo_authentication::JWT::claims` key in a request's context.
The claims object's `scope` key's value should be a space separated string of scopes in the format defined by the [OAuth2 RFC for access token scopes](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.3).

```
claims = context["apollo_authentication::JWT::claims"]
claims["scope"] = "scope1 scope2 scope3"
```

Depending on the scopes present on the request, the router filters out unauthorized fields and types.
If a field's required `scopes` array includes multiple scopes, the request must include _all_ required scopes to resolve it.

Like the efficiencies gained via the `@authenticated` directive, if every field on a particular subgraph query requires scopes that aren't present, this can eliminate entire subgraph requests.

#### Prerequisites

To use the `@requiresScopes` directive in a subgraph you can [import it from the `@link` directive](/federation/federated-types/federated-directives/#importing-directives) like so:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(
    url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.5",
    import: [..., "@requiresScopes"])
```

#### Example `@requiresScopes` use case

Imagine your social media platform lets users view other users' information only if they have the required permissions.
Your schema may look something like this:

```graphql title=""
type Query {
  me: User @authenticated
  user(id: ID!): User @requiresScopes(scopes: ["read:others"])
  users: [User!]! @requiresScopes(scopes: ["read:others"])
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  email: String @requiresScopes(scopes: ["read:email"])
  profileImage: String
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  author: User!
  title: String!
  content: String!
  views: Int @authenticated
}
```

The router executes the following query differently, depending on the request's attached scopes.

If the request includes only the `read:others` scope, then the router would execute the following filtered query:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Raw query to router"
query {
  users {
    name
    profileImage
    email
  }
}
```

```graphql title="Scopes: 'read:others'"
query {
  users {
    name
    profileImage
  }
}
```

</CodeColumns>

The response would include errors at the `/users/@/email` path since that field requires the `read:emails` scope.

If the request includes the `read:others read:emails` scope set, then the router can successfully execute the entire query.

## Composition and federation

Authorization directives are defined at the subgraph level and the GraphOS composes them in the supergraph schema. In other words, if subgraph fields or types include either `@authenticated` or `@requiresScopes` directives, they are set on the supergraph too.

If multiple shared subgraph fields include `@requiresScopes`, the supergraph schema merges the sets of scopes required by each subgraph. For example, imagine one subgraph requires the `read:others` scope on the `users` query:

```graphql title="Subgraph A"
type Query {
  users: [User!]! @requiresScopes(scopes: ["read:others"])
}
```

And another subgraph requires the `read:profiles` scope on `users` query:

```graphql title="Subgraph B"
type Query {
  users: [User!]! @requiresScopes(scopes: ["read:profiles"])
}
```

Then the supergraph schema would require _both_ scopes for it.

```graphql title="Supergraph"
type Query {
  users: [User!]! @requiresScopes(scopes: ["read:others", "read:profiles"])
}
```

### Authorization and `@key` fields

The [`@key` directive](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/entities/) lets you create an entity whose fields resolve across multiple subgraphs.
If you use authorization directives on fields defined in [`@key` directives](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/entities/), Apollo still uses those fields to compose entities between the subgraphs, but the client cannot query them directly.

Consider these example subgraph schemas:

```graphql title="Product subgraph"
type Query {
  product: Product
}

type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @authenticated
  name: String!
  price: Int @authenticated
}
```

```graphql title="Inventory subgraph"
type Query {
  product: Product
}

type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @authenticated
  inStock: Boolean!
}
```

An unauthenticated request would successfully execute this query:

```graphql
query {
  product {
    name
    inStock
  }
}
```

Specifically, under the hood, the router would use the `id` field to resolve the `Product` entity, but it wouldn't return it.

For the following query, an unauthenticated request would resolve `null` for `id`. And since `id` is a non-nullable field, `product` would return `null`.

```graphql
query {
  product {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

This behavior is similar to what you can create with [contracts](/graphos/delivery/contracts/) and the [`@inaccessible` directive](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federated-types/federated-directives/#inaccessible).

### Authorization and interfaces

If a type [implementing an interface](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/unions-interfaces/#interface-type) requires authorization, unauthorized requests can query the interface, but not any parts of the type that require authorization.

For example, consider this schema where the `Post` interface doesn't require authentication, but the `PrivateBlog` type which implements `Post` does:

```graphql
type Query {
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  posts: [Post!]!
}

interface Post {
  id: ID!
  author: User!
  title: String!
  content: String!
}

type PrivateBlog implements Post @authenticated {
  id: ID!
  author: User!
  title: String!
  content: String!
  publishAt: String
  allowedViewers: [User!]!
}
```

If an unauthenticated request were to make this query:

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    id
    author
    title
    ... on PrivateBlog {
      allowedViewers
    }
  }
}
```

The router would filter the query as follows:

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    id
    author
    title
  }
}
```

The response would include an `"UNAUTHORIZED_FIELD_OR_TYPE"` error at the `/posts/@/allowedViewers` path.

## Introspection

Authorization directives don't affect introspection; all fields that require authorization remain visible. However, directives applied to fields _aren't_ visible. If introspection might reveal too much information about internal types, then be sure to deactivate it:

```yaml
supergraph:
  introspection: false
```

You can also hide fields using [contracts](/graphos/delivery/contracts/).

## Query deduplication

When [query deduplication](/configuration/traffic-shaping/#query-deduplication) is activated for subgraphs, the authorization status is accounted for: the router groups unauthenticated queries together, and authenticated queries are grouped by scope set.
