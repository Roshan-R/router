You may need to restrict sensitive information to authorized users or roles or enforce conditional access rules for particular fields.
The Apollo Router allows you to restrict access to specific fields and types through the `@authenticated` and `@requiresScopes` directives:

- The `@authenticated` directive works in a binary way: requests are either authorized to access a specific field or type or they aren't.
- The `@requiresScopes` directive allows you granular access control through scopes that you define.

You define and use the directives on a sub-graph level, and the router [composes](#composition) them to the supergraph level.

## Prequisites

To use the router's authorization directives, you need to either configure [JWT authentication](./authn-jwt) or add a [router service coprocessor](../customizations/coprocessor). The JWT plugin validates the token, extract its claims, and sets them in the request context at the key `apollo_authentication::JWT::claims`.
To participate in the authorization process, a coprocessor needs to set the key `apollo_authentication::JWT::claims` in requests' context.

## Authorization directives

### `@authenticated`

The `@authenticated` directive marks specific fields and types as requiring authentication.
It works by checking for the`apollo_authentication::JWT::claims` key in a request's context.
If the request is authenticated, the router executes the query in its entirety.

For unauthenticated requests, the router removes `@authenticated` fields before planning the query.
The router filters out fields that require authentication and only executes the parts of the query that don't require it.
If every field in a particular subgraph's query is marked as requiring authentication, this can eliminate entire subgraph requests.

You can define the `@authenticated` directive on any subgraph schema like this:

```graphql
directive @authenticated on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION | INTERFACE | SCALAR | ENUM
```

#### Example `@authenticated` use case

Suppose you are building a social media platform and you only want authenticated users to be able to view other users' emails.
You also want to have a query called `me` that returns the authenticated user.

Your schema may look something like this:

```graphql
type Query {
  me: User @authenticated
  user(id: ID): User
}

type User {
  id: ID
  name: String
  email: String @authenticated
}
```

Consider the following query:

```graphql
query {
  me {
    name
    email
  }
  user(id: "1234") {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

An authenticated request would execute the entire query.
For an unauthenticated request, the router would remove the `@authenticated` fields before execution, and create a filtered query.

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Query for an authenticated request"
query {
  me {
    name
    email
  }
  user(id: "1234") {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

```graphql title="Filtered query for an unauthenticated request"
query {
  user(id: "1234") {
    name
  }
}
```

</CodeColumns>

For an unauthenticated request, the router doesn't attempt to resolve the top-level `me` query nor the email for the user with `id: "1234"`.
The response retains the initial request's shape but returns `null` for unauthorized fields and applies the [standard GraphQL null propagation rules](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/graphql/basics/using-nullability-in-graphql/#what-happens-if-you-try-to-return-null-for-a-non-null-field).

```json
{
  "data": {
    "me": null,
    "user": {
        "name": "Ada",
        "email": null
    }
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Unauthorized field or type",
      "path": [
        "me"
      ],
      "extensions": {
        "code": "UNAUTHORIZED_FIELD_OR_TYPE"
      }
    },
    {
      "message": "Unauthorized field or type",
      "path": [
        "user",
        "email"
      ],
      "extensions": {
        "code": "UNAUTHORIZED_FIELD_OR_TYPE"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

If every requested field requires authentication and a request is unauthenticated, the router generates a query planner error indicating that the query is unauthorized.

### `@requiresScopes`

The `@requiresScopes` directive marks fields and types as restricted based on the scopes you require.
You can define the `@requiredScopes` directive on any subgraph schema like this:

```graphql
directive @requiresScopes(scopes: [String!]!) on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION | INTERFACE | SCALAR | ENUM
```

The directive should include a `scopes` argument that expects an array of required scopes.

The directive validates the required scopes by loading the object at the `apollo_authentication::JWT::claims` key in a request's context.
That object's `scope` key should contain a space separated list of scopes in the format defined by [OAuth2 access token scopes](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.3).

Depending on the scopes present on the request, the router filters out unauthorized fields and types.
If a field's `scopes` array includes multiple scopes, the request must include _all_ required scopes to resolve it.

#### Example `@requiresScopes` use case

Imagine your social media platform has an ecommerce component.
You need to be able to query for the following:

- An authenticated user's profile (`me`)
- Other user's emails
- Products and the users who have ordered it

Your schema may look something like this:

```graphql
type Query {
  me: User @requiresScopes(scopes: ["profile:read"])
  products: [Products]
}

type User {
  id: ID
  name: String
  email: @requiresScopes(["user:read"])
}

type Product {
  id: ID
  name: String
  amount: Int @requiresScopes(["inventory:read"])
  orders: [User] @requiresScopes(["user:read", "inventory:read"])
}
```

The router executes the following query differently, depending on the request's attached scopes:

```graphql
query {
  me {
    name
    email
  }

  products {
    name
    amount
    orders {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

If the request includes the `profile:read user:read` scope set, then the router would execute the following filtered query: 

```graphql title="Request scopes: 'profile:read user:read'"
query {
  me {
    name
    email
  }

  products {
    name
    /* The following fields are filtered out:
    amount # Requires "inventory:read" scope
    orders # Requires "user:read" and "inventory:read" scopes
    */
  }
}
```

The response would include errors at the `/products/@/amount` and `/products/@/amount` paths.

If the request includes the `user:read inventory:read` scope set, then the router would execute the following filtered query: 

```graphql title="Request scopes: 'user:read inventory:read'"
query {
  /* The following fields are filtered out
  me { # Requires the "profile:read" scope
    name
    email
  }
  */
  products {
    name
    amount
    orders {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The response would include an error at the `/me` path.

## Introspection

Authorization directives don't affect introspection; all fields that require authorization remain accessible. Directives applied to fields aren't visible. If introspection might reveal too much information about internal types, then be sure to deactivate it:

```yaml
supergraph:
  introspection: false
```

You can also hide fields using [contracts](/graphos/delivery/contracts/).

## Query deduplication

When [query deduplication](/configuration/traffic-shaping/#query-deduplication) is activated for subgraphs, the authorization status is accounted for: the router groups unauthenticated queries together, and authenticated queries are grouped by scope set.

## Composition and federation

The authorization directives are defined by the subgraph author, and will be carried into the supergraph schema:
- `@authenticated`: if defined on a field or type by any of the subgraphs, it will be set in the supergraph too
- `@requiresScopes`: same as `@authenticated`, and if there are multiple applications, the supergraph schema will merge the sets of scopes required by each subgraph

### Authorization and `@key`

When the authorization directives are set on fields used in `@key`, they will be usable by the router to join between subgraphs, but cannot be queried directly by the client. This behavior is similar to [contracts](/graphos/delivery/contracts/) and the [`@inaccessible` directive](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federated-types/federated-directives/#inaccessible).

As an example, assuming we have these subgraphs definition:

```graphql
# subgraph A
type Query {
  t: T
}

type T @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @authenticated
}
```

```graphql
# subgraph B
type T @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @authenticated
  value: Int
}
```

The following query can be done when not authenticated:

```graphql
{
  t {
    value
  }
}
```

But this one would end up with a `null` in `id`, which would trigger nullability rules and nullify `t` too.

```graphql
{
  t {
    id
    value
  }
}
```

### Interfaces

In the case one of the types implementing an interface requires authorization, then querying the interface will be allowed, but any parts that require access to that type will be filtered.

As an example, with this schema, where the interface  `I` does not require authentication, but the `User` type does:

```graphql
type Query {
  itf: I!
}

interface I {
    id: ID
}

type User
implements I
@authenticated {
  id: ID
  name: String
}
```

If we send this query with an inline fragment and a type condition on `User`:

```graphql
query {
    itf {
        id
        ... on User {
          name
        }
    }
}
```

The query would be filtered as follows:

```graphql
query {
  itf {
    id
  }
}
```
