Learn about deploying a self-hosted supergraph with GraphOS and the Apollo Router on Kubernetes (k8s). Use Helm charts for the router, one with common configuration and another with custom, in-house configuration.

This guide covers:

* Explaining the Helm chart for Apollo Router
* Setting up your cluster and self-hosted router
* Configuring the router Helm chart and installing the router package


## About the router Helm chart

[Helm](https://helm.sh) is a package manager for Kubernetes. You create a Helm _chart_ to describe the resources in a package, then you install the chart with Helm to deploy the package on Kubernetes.

Apollo provides an application Helm chart with each release of Apollo Router in GitHub. The chart for the latest release of the router is available [here](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/v1.31.1/helm/chart/router).

Since version 0.14.0 of the router, Apollo has also released a Helm chart for the router as an [Open Container Initiative (OCI)](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/) image in the GitHub Container registry. The path to the OCI router chart is `oci://ghcr.io/apollographql/helm-charts/router`.

The released Helm chart sets specific values for the router, including:
* Coprocessor
* Header propagation
* Max request sizes
* Hot reload
* CORS
* Metrics and labels

The values of the Helm chart for Apollo Router v1.31.0 in the GitHub container repository, as output by the `helm show` command:

```bash
helm show values oci://ghcr.io/apollographql/helm-charts/router
```

### Separate common and environment-specific configurations

To support different deployment configurations for different environments (development, staging, production, etc.), Apollo recommends separating your configuration values into separate Helm charts:

- A **common** chart, containing values that apply across all environments.
- Unique **environment** charts, each including the common chart and overriding common values with environment-specific values or adding new values.


## Deploy router with Helm

### Install Helm

* Install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) **version 3**. The Apollo Router's Helm chart requires Helm v3.

> ⚠️ Your Kubernetes version must be compatible with Helm v3. For details, see [Helm Version Support Policy](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/version_skew/#supported-version-skew).

### Set up cluster

Install the tools and provision the infrastructure for your Kubernetes cluster.

For example, see the [Setup from Apollo's Build a Supergraph tutorial](https://github.com/apollosolutions/build-a-supergraph/tree/main/01-setup#01---setup). It provides steps you can reference for gathering accounts and credentials for your cloud platform (GCP or AWS), provisioning resources, and deploying your subgraphs.

(TODO: refine the steps between this #set-up-cluster and the next #set-up-self-hosted-router)

### Set up self-hosted router

Set up a self-hosted router by following the [first six steps of the self-hosted router quickstart](/graphos/quickstart/self-hosted), and stopping when you reach step [7. Deploy your router and connect clients](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/quickstart/self-hosted/#7-deploy-your-router-and-connect-clients).

## Install router Helm chart

You can install the router chart from either a local repository or the container registry.

### Install chart from container registry

* Login to the container registry by following the guide to [authenticating to the GitHub container registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-to-the-container-registry).

* After logging in, verify your access to the registry by showing the latest router chart from `helm`:

  ```bash
  helm show values oci://ghcr.io/apollographql/helm-charts/router
  ```

* Install the OCI image from the GiHub container registry:

  ```bash title="OCI registry"
  helm install --set router.configuration.telemetry.metrics.prometheus.enabled=true --set managedFederation.apiKey="<graph-api-key>" --set managedFederation.graphRef="<graph-ref>" --create-namespace --namespace router-deploy router-test oci://ghcr.io/apollographql/helm-charts/router --version 1.0.0-rc.8 --values router/values.yaml
  ```

### Install Helm chart from local repository

* Clone the [router repository](https://github.com/apollographql/router).

* Change to the directory in your local repo with the router chart:

  ```bash
  cd <repo-directory>/helm/chart
  ```

* Install the local chart, `router`:

  ```bash title="Local repository"
  helm install --set router.configuration.telemetry.metrics.prometheus.enabled=true --set managedFederation.apiKey="<graph-api-key>" --set managedFederation.graphRef="<graph-ref>" --create-namespace --namespace router-deploy router-test router --values router/values.yaml
  ```

  (TODO: clean up and describe the used helm install flags)

  ```
  In both the following examples, we are using helm to install the router:
  - into namespace "router-deploy" (create namespace if it doesn't exist)
  - with helm install name "router-test"
  - with support for prometheus enabled
  ```

## Verify Helm chart deployment

After the router Helm chart has been installed, you can check on the status of the Helm deployment:

```bash
helm list --namespace router-deploy
```

## TODO (other topics to add)

### Kubernetes Configuration

If you aren't familiar with Helm, the following example illustrates how you could do the same thing manually or as a base for [kustomize](https://kustomize.io/).

This example is generated using `helm template` to generate the required Kubernetes configuration from our Helm chart (with Helm management annotations removed).

## The health endpoint

The router supports a health endpoint. You can see from the examples above how it can be used in a kubernetes deployment.

If you had a router running on port 8088 on your localhost, you could exercise the health endpoint as follows:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8088/health"
{"status":"UP"}
```

If you had a router running on your localhost, with default health-check configuration, you could exercise the health endpoint as follows:

curl "http://localhost:8088/health"


## Using `istio` with the router

The [istio service mesh](https://istio.io/) is a very popular choice for enhanced traffic routing within Kubernetes.

`istio-proxy` pod injection can cause an [issue](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/3533) in the router. The router may start executing at the same time that istio is reconfiguring networking for the router pod. This is an issue with `istio`, not the router, and you can resolve it by following the advice in [istio's injection documentation](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/common-problems/injection/#pod-or-containers-start-with-network-issues-if-istio-proxy-is-not-ready).
