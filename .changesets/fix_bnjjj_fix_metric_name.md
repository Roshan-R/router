### Rename batching metric for naming convention conformance ([PR #4424](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/4424))

In this release, the `apollo_router.operations.batching` metric has been renamed to  `apollo.router.operations.batching` to conform to our naming convention of a `apollo.router.` prefix.
